# My journey as a fitness professional

My personal training career and undergraduate course have provided me with the enjoyable opportunity of supporting my clients with a multitude of goals, whether that is to lose weight, improve physical performance, rehabilitate, or just to feel good. Rehabilitation involved the development of various exercise programmes for clients with musculoskeletal injuries or chronic health problems. For example, I worked alongside a patient who underwent reconstruction surgery on both feet and hence, struggled to walk unassisted. Following my 12-week intervention, she was able to walk for longer unaided, regaining her independence. She reported that she felt stronger and more self-confident. The success was partly due to my ability to apply the latest research which enabled me to prescribe a programme that was bespoke and effective.

Establishing trustworthy and professional client relationships are skills that I have refined whilst working as a personal trainer. During the screening of movements on my treatment table, I communicate clearly, explaining what was evaluated, and how we can tailor upcoming exercises to their needs. Being an active listener is a skill that I have realised is key to successful client rapport. This skill enables me to completely focus on the speaker; therefore, truly understand their goals and be able to respond empathetically. To further maintain a professional working environment, all client personal information is kept confidential under the General Data Protection Regulation. Not only have I improved my one-to-one relationships with clients but also with the rest of my health and fitness colleagues. Being part of a team enabled me to seek advice from others to improve exercise strategies and work creatively together when leading fitness classes.
