# Working with a client over lockdown

## Introduction

Throughout my journey as a personal trainer, I have had the enjoyable opportunity to work with clients of all ages, sex, and abilities. Some were athletes looking to optimise performance whilst others suffered from chronic health problems wanting to improve their quality of life. Through my experience and expertise, I have helped all my clients put their best foot forward and change their lives for the better. Today, I will share an experience that I have had with a more recent client. He has trained occasionally before working with me, but he is relatively new to a structured bespoke training regime. Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, he has felt the importance of looking after his physical and mental health. Here is a concise breakdown of the plan and what we achieved.

## Barriers and goals

The most immediate obstacle we faced was the lack of equipment and the closure of fitness facilities. Since the first lockdown in March 2020, the client developed bad lifestyle and eating habits. He felt ‘sluggish’ most days and was de-motivated to exercise which is relatable to how most people felt during these times. Adding to the complications, he has arthritis in the hips and worked a busy schedule.

Fortunately, the client owns a turbo trainer (indoor cycling equipment) and lives near a national park. This worked really well with his primary goal of improving his cardiovascular fitness and breaking the bad habits. After identifying his reasons for change, we have decided on some key SMART goals to move in the right direction. These included: drinking a pint of water when awake, building a yoga routine, staying consistent with the training, and being able to walk up flights of stairs without feeling breathless.

## Programming to overcome the obstacles

Starting with a lifestyle remedy, the client was actively encouraged to follow the weekly SMART goals to gradually progress into the plan. These goals were initially achievable within a few days; for instance, infusing fruits with water to help increase micronutrient and water intake consistently over 5 days. Achieving these goals are a great stepping stone to challenge the client in upcoming weeks. It promotes a sense of success and possibility which feels — amazing!

Working towards the longer term goal, the client was given high-intensity interval training on his cycle turbo trainer. He has mentioned previously that he found steady-state to be mundane. For this reason, Fartlek training was chosen not only for its cardiovascular benefits, but for its variability. Each session would be different with a specific focus and varying durations. The client really enjoyed this type of training and was adhering to it.
