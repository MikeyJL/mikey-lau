## Introduction

This is my personal website but I thought I share the code with you.

I'm a big fan of Vue and Nuxt with a touch of SCSS. The main objective is to of course show off my skillset but to also build a good website. I wanted to be fast, minimal, and responsive.

## Responsiveness

As expected, I've used media querys to adjust the css profile of the site to make sure that it is suited for mobile users. Furthermore, I've added fluid typography as outlined by [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/fluid-typography/) which adapts the font size to screen size.

## Design

As you can probably tell, I'm a massive fan of simplistic design and colour schemes. However, if asked of me, I can still produce UI that are colourful. The decision to do this was not just a matter of personal preference, but rather to focus on making it accessible and to provide good contrast between elements.
